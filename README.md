# Titanic-Dataset-EDA

I've tried to implement my data cleaning skills on the Titanic dataset (train.csv). 

I've done statistical exploratory data analysis on colab using python to prepare the dataset for implementing machine learning model.

I may later use this dataset for predicting survival rates using the test dataset.
